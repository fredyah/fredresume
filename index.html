                            Hello, 
                            my name is Fred (Yeh Shau Tang), and I am based in New Taipei City, Taiwan, near Taipei City (UTC+8). 
                            
                            I am an experienced DevOps engineer with 3 years of hands-on expertise in a variety of technologies, including Linux, Git, GitLab, Jenkins, Bash/Shell scripting, Python, C#, Batch scripting, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, NGINX, AWS, MySQL, and Redis.
                            
                            I have successfully deployed and managed environments across multiple platforms, including:
                            
                            Frontend: PHP, Node.js
                            Backend: Django, PHP
                            Mobile Apps: Android Studio, Flutter, Xcode, Fastlane

                            As part of my future plans, I aim to find a remote job that allows me to balance professional growth and family responsibilities, as I intend to get married and start a family within the next two years. I am committed to dedicating 95% of my working hours to professional tasks, while reserving 5% for ensuring my child's safety, if necessary.

                            In my free time, I enjoy self-improvement and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies through platforms like YouTube.

                            With a strong passion for continuous learning and efficient systems management, I am eager to contribute to a forward-thinking organization in the DevOps field.
